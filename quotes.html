		<h3>&nbsp&nbspFavorite Quote</h3>
			<blockquote>"If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together... there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, 
					stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we're apart... I'll always be with you." <cite>A.A. Milne</cite>

		<h3>&nbsp&nbspChanged For Good</h3>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbspWhen I was younger, I thought I would be moving away for college.  I imagined myself being in the position of saying goodbye to my family and 
				saying hello to my new chapter in life.  However, the May before my first semester of college, I learned that <em>dream</em> wouldn't become a reality. 
				With the factors of sleeping and fevers, my family came to the conclusion that it would be the best thing for me to commute to and from school 
				so that I wouldn't rack up a hefty medical bill in the case of needing to be transported to a hospital.  However, with commuting, there came a 
				whole lot of responsibilities and changes in life.
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspAfter commuter orientation, I texted my parents that I was on my way home, but was debating about going to the reception dinner to meet people 
				and get to know the freshman class.  Little did I know, the next moment would change my outlook on life. I got a perplexing text:  <q>This is 
				your college experience, not ours.</q> Wait, what?  That's not the response I thought I would get.  As I drove down 50<sup>th</sup>, I thought about that 
				text. 
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspThroughout my childhood, and even through high school, my parents had always seen me off to my first day of school to my last day of school. 
				However, not today. Instead of going through the typical orientation of parents helping their college bound kid move into their dorm room, 
				meeting hall mates, and saying good bye until the holidays, my parents decided it would be better for me to experience this all on my own. This 
				feeling of being alone and the unknown is unlike anything I've felt before, and I feel a part of me is missing - especially on a day that meant 
				so much to me. 
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspWhat did that text really mean?  What are they trying to tell me?  Maybe I was surprised that they would say such a thing.  Maybe it's because 
				it was so different than <q>normal.</q> 
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspI have had an un-diagnosed medical condition since the third grade. I have seen several doctors at the Children's Hospital in Colorado and the 
				National Institute of Health in Maryland. So far, there have been no possible diagnoses even though several doctors have tried. Every other week, 
				I used to get severely sick with a fever ranging from 90 to 108 degrees Fahrenheit with severe headaches and backaches. During this time, I would 
				sleep, and only sleep. My longest duration of sleep is 104 hours. That was 4.33 days of no waking up, no eating, nothing that a normal human 
				being would do. Unfortunately, this places a heavy restriction on any and all activity. The next step would be traveling to the World Health 
				Organization in Israel, but that has not been an option recently due to social and political unrest in the Middle East. This medical condition 
				has affected every aspect of my life over the past ten years, and it greatly affected my college decision.
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspOver the past eighteen years, I have been so <i>dependent</i> on my family.  I was <i>limited</i> : sleepovers, parties, and nights out with friends were harder 
				with timing and doctor's office visits;  I didn't drive until the end of my Senior year of high school; I didn't have a job. So much of me comes 
				from what I have learned from them over the years.  The past three months had really enforced becoming more independent of them:  I socialized 
				with friends more, drove myself places, volunteered at a summer camp for the 4th year, started looking for jobs, and payed my own expenses. 
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspBeing so independent of them on my first day of college was weird. It's hard to say I was completely okay with them not being there.  It's weird 
				being alone on this experience, especially since I had a special circumstance of dependency on my parents. My parents were my socialization with 
				the world for the most part of growing up. Not knowing what to do and just being an outcast in the crowd wasn't different, but the feeling of 
				being lost was weird.  Not directionally, but mentally.  I just wanted one of them there to help me through the process and be there to help me 
				off into my new chapter.  Was that too much to ask for? While some people would rather not have had their parents with them, I really wish I had. 
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspAfter lingering on it, I came to the conclusion that they want me to put myself out there and <b>become independent</b> - socially, emotionally, and 
				personally. While I understand why they made that decision to let me be independent, I don't think they made it at the right time. The first day 
				of college is a big step in someone's life. Really becoming an adult and stepping out of your little piece of the world into the bigger, unknown 
				parts is very different. Had they made the choice to let me be independent the other days of orientation, I would have been okay. I understand 
				that parents are going to be wrong or make decisions that aren't necessarily always right in their child's eyes. Now, I understand that they 
				wanted to give me that freedom of being independent because I hadn't really had that option throughout my life. Because of that special 
				dependency and with the new independency, there are going to be more moments where there is tension in deciding what's right for them and me. 
				<br/ > <br/ >
				&nbsp&nbspThey didn't come with me not because: they didn't want to be there, to see me begin my new chapter, or because they didn't have time; my parents 
				wanted me to experience college on my own. Because of that, <strong> I have been changed for good.</strong>
